# PokemonAppOtsimo


This is the mobile developer task which is provided by Otsimo. I have been trying to do somethings on it for almost 4-5 days.
First, I have created two different models for pokemons. One of them holds basic pokemon details and other one holds the url of pokemons. In this url, there are some particular details of pokemons such as abilities, photos, stats. In the first model, I fetched the basic model data, and in the second one I fetched the other details of data of pokemons. 

Secondly, I created a list view which is able to show all name and photos of pokemons, when tap the pokemons that you want, the app is going to details page. In this detail page, users can reach out a pokemon card that has name photo and abilities of pokemons like HP, attack and defense. 

Unfotunately, I were not able to do card flip animation. Actually, I designed a simple animation you can find in the project files, but I could not make exactly you want. But I wanted to share a project that I can show myself. 

Thank you very much for your time and interest.
